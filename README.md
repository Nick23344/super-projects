- CSS Styling and Form Layout: Practiced CSS techniques to style form elements, manage layout with display, and ensure a clean, accessible design with fieldset and label elements.
- Responsive Design: Used percentage-based widths and media queries to ensure the form adapts to various screen sizes.
- Accessibility: Learned to enhance accessibility by labeling inputs correctly, grouping related inputs, and using placeholders to guide users.
- Form Validation: Applied basic HTML validation with required attributes and input constraints (e.g., min and max values for the age input).
